## Adding new games
To add new games, take a look at example_app. Only requirement for created games is that the user should be able to close them from the controller.
After you make you new game, you will need to add it to the list of `APPS` in main.py. You just need to add the command that needs to be ran to launch your game.

To run, install the libraries in `requirements.txt` and then run `main.py`
